\section*{Introduction}

This is a report for the introductory assignment in the course ID1021 Algorithms and Data Structures. In this assignment, the efficiency of three simple operations operating on arrays should be explored.

The focus is not on the implementation of these operations but rather on measuring their execution time and exploring how the execution time grows as the algorithms are executed with larger values.
